4. How to Run This Software
Set Up Your Database(s):

Create a MySQL database named car_rental (and optionally profile_db if needed).
Create a users table with columns matching the code (id, name, email, password, profile_image, etc.).
Insert some test data for at least one admin user (with role_id = 1) and some non-admin users (with role_id = 2, for example).
Place the Files on a Web Server (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP, LAMP):

profile.html, profile.js, profile.css in a public-accessible folder.
The PHP files (get_juser.php, admin_get_client_select.php, admin_get_client_list.php, etc.) in the same or a subfolder, ensuring your paths in the JS are correct.
Adjust the URLs:

In profile.js, make sure the AJAX calls point to the correct filenames. For example:
js
Code kopieren
url: 'get_juser.php', // or get_user.php, whichever name you choose
Open profile.html in your browser:

Enter a user ID in the “UserID for Simulation” field.
Click the “Get User Details” button (the image).
If the ID corresponds to an admin, you’ll see the Client List and a blank Client Details panel.
If the ID corresponds to a normal user, you’ll see the single “Your Profile Details” panel.
5. Conclusion
What the software does:
A simple user-profile system with separate views for admin and regular users. Admin can see a list of all users and dig into each user’s detail. A regular user can only see their own details.

Strengths:

Clear separation of concerns (admin vs. non-admin).
Simple, direct use of AJAX to fetch JSON data and display it.
Straightforward UI.
Areas for Improvement:

Fix the naming inconsistencies ( dmin_get_client_details.php vs. admin_get_client_select.php).
Fix typos in the goDETAILS() function.
Unify the database references or clearly separate them if needed.
Implement a real update flow (the updateDETAILS() function and admin_update_profile.php can be tied together properly).
Consider authentication and security (sessions, tokens, etc.) for a production-level app.
With these adjustments and clarifications, the code can serve as a solid demo or starting point for a basic user management interface.
